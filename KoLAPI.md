# KoLAPI #

[KoLAPI](KoLAPI.md) is a Object Oriented API for automating the gameplay (e.g. building a bot) of the [Kingdom of Loathing](http://www.kingdomofloathing.com) game.

The goal of [KoLAPI](KoLAPI.md) is to provide a flexible interface for writing bots that gives the developer as much control and information as possible while hiding the mundane details from them (e.g. dealing with HTTP, parsing results, etc..).

Support Languages:
  * [Perl](Perl.md)
