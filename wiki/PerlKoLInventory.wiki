*WARNING:*

This module is currently under active development. This means that:

  # The API is not complete and functionality is being added and changed as it is developed.
  # The documentation is likely not up to date with the code.

Using any functionality of this module at this time is just silly and at your own risk.

You've been warned!

= Introduction =

This module manages information about the character's inventory.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= TODO =

This is a stub module. Count on nothing staying the same.

==Methods==
===new(%args)===
This is the constructor of the object and simply sets up the data storage.

The [PerlKoLSession KoL::Session] instance for the character you are working with is required in the _%args_ hash using the 'session' key.

If there is an error, _undef_ is returned and _$@_ is set.

*Example:*
{{{
my $inv = KoL::Inventory->new('session' => $sess);
}}}

===itemInfo($id)===
Returns a hash reference of information obtained from 'desc_item.php'. It also stores this information to reduce requests back to the [http://www.kingdomofloathing.com KoL] servers.

The _$id_ value is the item description ID for the item you are looking up. In many cases you have to look your item up using [PerlKoLWiki#getPage($name) KoL::Wiki->getPage()] to find it in the [http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php KoL Wiki].

If there is an error the method returns _undef_ and sets _$@_.

*Example:*

{{{
my $info = $inv->itemInfo(802361695);
if (!$info) {
    print "Unable to retrieve info for 802361695: $@\n";
    exit(1);
}
}}}
