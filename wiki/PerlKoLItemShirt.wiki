= Introduction =

This object represents a Shirt item.

This object is a subclass of [PerlKoLItemEquipment KoL::Item::Equipment]. Please see the documentation for more details on the functionality of this object.

==Methods==
===new(%args)===
This is the constructor of the object and should only ever be called by [PerlKoLItem#new(%args) KoL::Item->new()].

This object does not take any additional hash arguments beyond what [PerlKoLItemEquipment#new(%args) KoL::Item::Equipment->new()] uses.

===subtype()===
The _subtype()_ method is stubbed out as shirts do not have sub-types.
