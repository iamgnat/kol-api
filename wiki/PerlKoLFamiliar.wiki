#summary KoL::Familiar module
#sidebar PerlTOC

= Introduction =

This module offers an object oriented view of a familiar. Instances of this object are intended to be created by [PerlKoLFamiliars#update() KoL::Familiars->update()] and as such the functionality to change familiar information will not be documented.

==Methods==
===exists()===
Returns a 1 or 0 if the familiar still exists.

As there does not appear to be a way to actively delete a familiar in the game, a 0 result really indicates some type of an error.

If there is an error during processing, 0 is returned and _$@_ is set.

*Example:*

{{{
my $res = $fam->exists();
if (!$res && $@) {
    print "Unable to check existence of familiar: $@\n";
} elsif (!$res) {
    print "No such familiar.\n";
} else {
    print "Familiar exists.\n";
}
}}}

===id()===
===name()===
===weight()===
===type()===
===exp()===
===kills()===
These methods return the named stat of the familiar.

In the event of an error, _undef_ is returned and _$@_ is set.

*Examples:*

{{{
my $id = $fam->id();
my $name = $fam->name();
my $weight = $fam->weight();
my $type = $fam->type();
my $exp = $fam->exp();
my $kills = $fam->kills();
}}}

===equip()===
This method returns a [PerlKoLItem KoL::Item] reference to the familiar's equipped item.

If the familiar does not currently have an item equipped or an error occurs, _undef_ is returned. In the event of an error, _$@_ is set to the error message.

*Example:*

{{{
my $equip = $fam->equip();
if (!$equip && $@) {
    print "Unable to get familiar's equipment: $@\n";
} elsif (!$equip) {
    print "Familiar is not equipped.\n";
} else {
    print "Familiar is equipped.\n";
}
}}}

===isCurrent()===
Returns 1|0 if the familiar is the current familiar or not.

If there is an error, 0 is returned and _$@_ is set.

*Example:*

{{{
my $curr = $fam->isCurrent();
if (!$curr && $@) {
    print "Unable to check if familiar is the current one: $@\n";
} elsif (!$curr) {
    print "Not current.\n";
} else {
    print "Current.\n";
}
}}}
