*WARNING:*

This module is currently under active development. This means that:

  # The API is not complete and functionality is being added and changed as it is developed.
  # The documentation is likely not up to date with the code.

Using any functionality of this module at this time is just silly and at your own risk.

You've been warned!

= Introduction =

This module manages information about the character.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= TODO =

Just consider this a temporary place holder and everything will potentially change.

==Methods==
===new(%args)===
This is the constructor of the object and simply sets up the data storage.

The [PerlKoLSession KoL::Session] instance for the character you are working with is required in the _%args_ hash using the 'session' key.

If there is an error, _undef_ is returned and _$@_ is set.

*Example:*
{{{
my $char = KoL::Character->new('session' => $sess);
}}}

===update()===
If no information is cached or the last time it was cached was before the [PerlKoL KoL->dirty()] time, this method requests 'charsheet.php' and gathers information from it.

The result is 1|0 based on success or failure. In the event of a failure, _$@_ is set to a meaningful value.

*Example:*

{{{
$char->update();
}}}
