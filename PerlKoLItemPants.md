# Introduction #

This object represents a Pants item.

This object is a subclass of [KoL::Item::Equipment](PerlKoLItemEquipment.md). Please see the documentation for more details on the functionality of this object.

## Methods ##
### new(%args) ###
This is the constructor of the object and should only ever be called by [KoL::Item->new()](PerlKoLItem#new(%args).md).

This object does not take any additional hash arguments beyond what [KoL::Item::Equipment->new()](PerlKoLItemEquipment#new(%args).md) uses.

### subtype() ###
The _subtype()_ method is stubbed out as pants do not have sub-types.
